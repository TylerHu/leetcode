/**
 * LeetCode100. Same Tree(https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/description/)
 *
 * Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
 * Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.
 *
 * Solution: Check whether node p and q both are null, or whether their values are the same. Do it recursively to the
 * left subtree and right subtree.
